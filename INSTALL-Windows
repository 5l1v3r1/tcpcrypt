Installing tcpcrypt on Windows
==============================

Tcpcrypt has only been tested on Windows XP.

Dependencies
============

* Cygwin and these packages:
  * libopenssl098
  * openssl-devel
  * gcc


Compiling
=========

From the tcpcrypt/user directory, run `make`. 


Installing
==========

The Windows implementation of tcpcrypt has two components: the kernel divert socket driver and the userland daemon.

Installing the kernel driver
-------------------------

1. Open the Properties window of your network interface
2. Click "Install..."
3. Choose "Service", click "Add...", and then "Have Disk..."
4. Browse to the tcpcrypt/kernel/win directory (with netsf.inf), click "Open", and then click "OK"
5. With "Passthru Driver" selected, click "OK"

Now you are ready to run the userland tcpcryptd daemon.

Running
=======

After installing the divert socket driver, run the tcpcryptd daemon with the following command, from tcpcrypt/user:

    ./launch_tcpcryptd.sh

By default, this script tells tcpcryptd to use the first network interface listed in `ipconfig /all`. If you want to use a different interface, run tcpcryptd manually:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/ tcpcrypt/tcpcryptd -x 0a:1b:2c:3d:4f:6a
