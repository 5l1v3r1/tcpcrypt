Mac OS X 10.6
-------------

The default Mac OS X 10.6 install comes with an old version of OpenSSL. To run
tcpcrypt, you must install OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later and configure with:

   ./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc shared

Then, running `make` will build libssl.dylib in openssl/. If you run `make
install_sw`, you're finished. If you don't want to install the openssl libs
globally, then before you run any of the tcpcrypt binaries you just built, set
the env var DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to the full path of the openssl/ dir containing
the libssl.dylib you just built.

Firewall setup

1. FreeBSD & Mac OS.  Linux users, read this too.

   ipfw 01 add divert 666 tcp from any to any

   This will divert all TCP packets to tcpcryptd [divert port 666], and it will
   add it as rule #1.  It's important that this rule is high on the list since
   tcpcryptd modifies the packet quite a lot, including sequence numbers, so
   other items (e.g., natd) may get confused if tcpcryptd doesn't do its magic
   first.
