   ipfw 01 add divert 666 tcp from any to any

   This will divert all TCP packets to tcpcryptd [divert port 666], and it will
   add it as rule #1.  It's important that this rule is high on the list since
   tcpcryptd modifies the packet quite a lot, including sequence numbers, so
   other items (e.g., natd) may get confused if tcpcryptd doesn't do its magic
   first.
